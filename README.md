This is an online program hosted by Forage and Accenture Nordics. This program contains workplace examples of five business units from Accenture, namely `Architecture`, `Programming`, `Testing`, `Security`, and `Artificial Intelligence`. 

## Architecture
In this section, the tasks are as follows:  
* Define technical requirements  
* Design changes to an existing architecture  
* Scale on-premise system infrastructure to the cloud  

In the example, we help the client Digital Healthcare design a system for booking a doctor's appointments, analyze new features and scale the system into a cloud based architecutre.   
In particular, we confirm with the client the following questions:  
    
__Scalability__  
* How many users must be supported?  
* Is the number of users expected to increase in the future?  
__Performance__  
* How fast should the system respond?  
__Recoverability__  
* How does the system recover after a failure?  
__Security__  
* How should data be protected?  
* How are different sorts of attacks prevented?  
__Maintainability__  
* Does the system need to be easily maintained?  
__Operability__  
* How is the system operated and managed?  
__Availability__  
* Does the system need to be available 24x7?

## Programming
In this section, we refractor some codes from colleagues. Here JavaScript and Python are used.   
Tasks include:
* Reading and understanding code  
* Attention to detail  
* Debugging algorithms  


## Testing
In this section, we implement unit testing and explore User Acceptance Testing (UAT) for Email validation.  
A requirement brief is uploaded.  Below is one example.  
   
7.1 Account 
   These functions are connected to creation of user accounts and login to user accounts. An account is exclusive to a single user 
7.1.1 Login 
   REQ-Account-1 Login page 
   A registered user should be able to login with their email and chosen password and should be redirected to the home page after a successful login.
     
__Test case__: (to test requirement 7.1.1 Login)
  
__Test Description__: User Log in – Verify that email and password match for an existing user and that the user can log in.  
__Prerequisite__: The user must have registered an account and not currently be logged in on the platform.   
__Assumption__: The user is using the Latin alphabet.    
__Test steps__   
    1. Start the application   
    2. Enter email   
    3. Enter password   
    4. Press “Login” button    
__Expected Result__: The user is logged in and is directed to the home page.   


## Security
In this section, we assess and implement security policies for a client.  
Tasks include:  
* Security maturity assessment  
* IAM policies and permissions  
* Securing the software development lifecycle (SDLC)  


## Artificial Intelligence
In this section, we interpret the funtionality the client is asking and point out the data and privacy issues.  
* Shaping the Problem  
* Data and privacy
